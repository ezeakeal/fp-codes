    "* Made a basic implementation which compares variables directly. Comprehensions will make it more concise but less readable, and sometimes harder to modify.\n",

    "* Looked up XOR of bytestring - https://stackoverflow.com/a/15106386 - but would end up running more operations on the data. If bigger data was being tested - maybe use numpy to do some faster comparisons, or write code in C to manipulate the binary representations of the data. That being said, maybe streaming would be worth checking out. "
