    "### Thought process\n",
    "* Re-read the problem, and I can now see that the arbitrary range is an 'arbitrary range of **existing** values'! Now it makes sense.. I was thinking of writing a function to generate random data\n",
    "    * After solving the problem using MySQL 5.6 on SQLFiddle, I am hesitant to put more time into this challenge - especially as SQLLite3 has limited support in some areas.\n",
    "* Assuming for this exercise, the score type is DOUBLE with 4 digits, 2 after the point (00.00) - imagining a percentage range.\n",
    "* Found this example, https://stackoverflow.com/a/7747342, row_number probably what I want for this but that seems so wrong. Maybe Rank/Dense_rank takes parameters\n",
    "* Found another comparison of rank/dense_rank/row_number: https://blog.jooq.org/2013/10/09/sql-trick-row_number-is-to-select-what-dense_rank-is-to-select-distinct/\n",
    "* I'll go ahead with row_number for now anyway just to have a solution\n",

    "2. `sql rank unique` - found dense_rank mentioned, seems required.\n",
    "3. Found this example, https://stackoverflow.com/a/7747342, row_number probably what I want for this but that seems so wrong. \n",
    "4. Several frantic repeated searches for SQLite3 row_number work-arounds. Gave up eventually and ran MySQL 5.6 online.\n",
